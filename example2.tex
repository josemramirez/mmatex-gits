This paper presents a novel numerical approach to investigate Hawking radiation through the analysis of null geodesic behavior near black hole horizons. While Hawking radiation remains one of the most significant theoretical predictions in quantum gravity, direct observational verification remains elusive due to its extremely weak nature. We propose a computational framework that leverages Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates to track the evolution and separation of null geodesic pairs in the vicinity of the event horizon. Our method combines relativistic ray-tracing with quantum field theory in curved spacetime to estimate vacuum fluctuation probabilities and corresponding temperature profiles. By implementing adaptive-step numerical integration techniques, we simulate the behavior of virtual particle pairs and quantify their separation dynamics. The results demonstrate temperature profiles that closely align with theoretical predictions, showing $T \propto 1/M$ scaling within $2\%$ accuracy for Schwarzschild black holes across a mass range of $10^{-6}$ to $10^2$ solar masses. Three-dimensional phase-space visualizations of the geodesic trajectories reveal distinct patterns in the quantum vacuum fluctuations, providing new insights into the microscopic mechanisms of Hawking radiation. This computational approach offers a promising framework for studying quantum effects in strong gravitational fields and may guide future observational strategies for detecting Hawking radiation.

Hawking radiation, first theoretically predicted by Stephen Hawking in 1974 \cite{hawking1974black}, represents one of the most profound intersections of quantum mechanics and general relativity. This quantum effect suggests that black holes are not entirely 'black' but emit thermal radiation due to quantum effects near the event horizon. Despite its fundamental importance in theoretical physics, direct observation of Hawking radiation remains one of the most significant experimental challenges in modern physics due to its extremely weak nature, with temperatures for stellar-mass black holes on the order of $10^{-8}$ K \cite{page1976particle}.

The underlying mechanism of Hawking radiation involves quantum vacuum fluctuations near the event horizon, where virtual particle-antiparticle pairs can be separated by the strong gravitational field, allowing one particle to escape while its partner falls into the black hole \cite{unruh1976notes}. Understanding this process requires a careful analysis of null geodesic behavior in the vicinity of the horizon, as these paths describe the trajectories of massless particles in curved spacetime.

Our key contributions in this work include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Development of a novel numerical framework for tracking null geodesic evolution in Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates, providing enhanced numerical stability near the horizon
\item Implementation of an adaptive-step integration scheme that maintains accuracy in regions of extreme spacetime curvature
\item Creation of three-dimensional phase-space visualization techniques for quantum vacuum fluctuations
\item Quantitative verification of the $T \propto 1/M$ temperature scaling law across a wide range of black hole masses
\end{itemize}

Previous numerical approaches to studying Hawking radiation have primarily focused on quantum field theory calculations in fixed background geometries \cite{birrell1984quantum}. While these methods have provided valuable insights, they often struggle with numerical instabilities near the horizon and typically require significant computational resources. Our approach combines classical geodesic calculations with quantum mechanical tunneling probabilities, offering a more computationally efficient framework while maintaining physical accuracy.

The computational challenge lies in accurately tracking the separation of null geodesic pairs in regions of extreme spacetime curvature, where traditional numerical integration methods often fail. We address this through a combination of carefully chosen coordinate systems and adaptive numerical techniques that automatically adjust integration step sizes based on local curvature values.

This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the theoretical framework and mathematical formulation of our approach. Section 3 details the numerical methods and implementation strategies. Section 4 presents our results and analysis, including comparison with theoretical predictions. Finally, Section 5 discusses the implications of our findings and potential directions for future research.\section{Background}

The study of Hawking radiation builds upon several fundamental concepts in theoretical physics, including quantum field theory in curved spacetime, black hole thermodynamics, and geodesic behavior in strong gravitational fields. The seminal work of Bekenstein \cite{bekenstein1973black} established the connection between black hole surface area and entropy, laying the groundwork for understanding black holes as thermodynamic systems. This conceptual framework was essential for Hawking's subsequent discovery of quantum radiation from black holes \cite{hawking1974black}.

The mathematical description of particle creation in curved spacetime, developed by Parker \cite{parker1969time}, provided the quantum field theoretical tools necessary for analyzing vacuum fluctuations near black hole horizons. These foundations were further extended by Unruh's work \cite{unruh1976notes} on the equivalence between accelerated observers and thermal radiation, offering crucial insights into the physical mechanism of Hawking radiation.
