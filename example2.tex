In this work, we introduce an interactive visualization tool designed to depict the intricate light cone structure in the vicinity of a black hole horizon using Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates, enabling a comprehensive exploration of the deformation of light paths and causal connections as they approach and cross the event horizon. The primary aim of our study is to bridge the gap between abstract relativistic concepts and intuitive understanding by offering an immersive experience that dynamically illustrates how light cones tilt and warp under extreme gravitational effects. This visualization framework is particularly challenging due to the inherent complexities in mapping relativistic spacetime geometries into an accessible three-dimensional representation, as well as the computational constraints involved in rendering accurate causal trajectories in real-time. Our contribution leverages advanced computational methods alongside rigorous coordinate transformations to generate 3D plots that not only display the evolution of causality near a black hole but also permit users to alter viewing perspectives corresponding to various reference frames. We validate our approach through a series of experiments that include both qualitative visual assessments and quantitative comparisons with theoretical predictions, thereby confirming that our tool effectively elucidates the key features of horizon crossing phenomena.\end{abstract}\section{Introduction}
\section{Introduction}
In this work, we introduce an interactive visualization tool designed to depict the intricate light cone structure in the vicinity of a black hole horizon using Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates. Our primary goal is to bridge the gap between abstract relativistic concepts and intuitive understanding by offering an immersive experience that dynamically illustrates the deformation of light paths and causal connections as they approach and cross the event horizon. This is particularly relevant in light of the ongoing quest to provide accessible yet rigorous depictions of complex gravitational phenomena \cite{Reference1 Reference2}.The challenge of this endeavor is twofold. First, mapping relativistic spacetime geometries into an accessible three-dimensional representation necessitates precise and computationally intensive coordinate transformations, especially when simulating the extreme deformations of light cones that occur near a black hole horizon. Second, rendering accurate causal trajectories in real-time requires advanced computational strategies to handle the inherent nonlinearity in Einstein's equations and the associated parameters such as $\gamma$, $\beta$, and $\delta$, which play a crucial role in governing the propagation of light under strong gravitational fields \cite{Reference3}.Our contributions can be summarized as follows:\begin{itemize}  \item We develop an interactive visualization framework that leverages Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates to generate accurate three-dimensional plots, clearly illustrating the evolution of light cones near a black hole horizon.  \item We implement advanced computational techniques to perform rigorous coordinate transformations, thereby accurately capturing the deformation of causal trajectories as light approaches and crosses the event horizon.  \item We validate our approach through a series of experiments, including qualitative visual assessments and quantitative comparisons with established theoretical predictions, confirming the fidelity and utility of our visualization tool \cite{Reference4}.  \item We provide an open platform that not only enhances the educational understanding of relativistic phenomena but also lays the foundation for future extensions, such as integration with augmented and virtual reality systems for broader interactive applications.\end{itemize}The significance of this research lies in its potential to transform how complex spacetime geometries are studied and understood, providing both a novel methodological approach and a practical tool that can be expanded upon in future work.\section{Background}
\section{Background}
The study of causal structures in curved spacetimes forms a cornerstone of modern gravitational physics \cite{Reference1 Reference2}. Pioneering works in this domain have established the mathematical foundations for analyzing how light propagates in the presence of strong gravitational fields, particularly in the vicinity of black holes. These academic ancestors introduced the concept of null geodesics and causal diagrams, which paved the way for the development of advanced visualization techniques aimed at rendering abstract relativistic phenomena more accessible. In this context, the use of coordinate systems such as the advanced Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates has been crucial for exposing the subtleties of horizon crossing and causal connectivity \cite{Reference3}.\subsection{Problem Setting}The central challenge addressed in this work is the visualization of deformed light cone structures near a black hole horizon. Our approach formalizes the problem as follows. Given a black hole characterized by its mass parameter $M$, we consider a spacetime described by the advanced Eddington-Finkelstein metric. In this spacetime, the trajectories of light are represented by null geodesics, whose behavior is dictated by the underlying gravitational field. The problem is to accurately model and dynamically visualize the deformation and tilting of these light cones as functions of the spacetime coordinates $(t, r, \theta, \phi)$, particularly as they approach and cross the event horizon.To address this problem, several specific assumptions are made:\begin{enumerate}  \item The black hole spacetime is assumed to be stationary and spherically symmetric, which simplifies the metric and the analysis of null trajectories.  \item Effects due to rotation or external perturbations are neglected to ensure the computational tractability of the visualization algorithm.  \item The advanced Eddington-Finkelstein metric is assumed to provide an accurate local representation of the spacetime geometry in the vicinity of the event horizon.\end{enumerate}Our work extends the existing methodologies by incorporating an interactive element into the visualization tool. This interactive framework not only computes the rigorous coordinate transformations required to capture the evolution of light cones but also allows for real-time exploration of the causal structure. By doing so, we provide a novel means to bridge abstract theoretical constructs with intuitive, visual insights, thereby addressing long-standing challenges in the educational dissemination and practical understanding of horizon crossing phenomena \cite{Reference4}.\end{document}
